# Cursor Browser Scraping Demo

## Current Status

✅ **Browser is open** in Cursor IDE  
✅ **Page loaded**: https://www.ducati.com/ww/en/bikes/multistrada/multistrada-v4-rally  
✅ **Page title**: "New Multistrada V4 Rally - Designed to take you anywhere"

## What I Can Do with Cursor Browser

I can use Cursor's browser MCP tools to:

1. **Navigate** - Already done! The page is loaded
2. **Take Screenshots** - I've captured the full page
3. **Click Elements** - I can click carousels, accordions, buttons
4. **Extract Content** - Get text, images, and data
5. **Interact** - Click through tabs, expand sections, navigate carousels

## Demonstration Plan

I'll now demonstrate the scraping by:

1. **Finding carousel arrows** and clicking through to reveal all images
2. **Finding accordion triggers** and expanding them
3. **Clicking "EXPLORE" buttons** to navigate to insights pages
4. **Extracting all content** from the page

Watch the Cursor browser window - you'll see me interact with the page!

## Integration

The Python extraction code in `src/extractors/` is designed to work with Playwright.
However, I can demonstrate the same interactions using Cursor's browser tools.

The key difference:
- **Playwright**: Headless browser controlled by Python code
- **Cursor Browser**: Visible browser in IDE, controlled by MCP tools

Both can perform the same scraping tasks - you just see it happen in Cursor's browser!
